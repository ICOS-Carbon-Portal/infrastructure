## Upgrading postgresql

Upgrading postgres between minor versions (which for versions 10 and beyond
means changing the second versions, i.e 10.8 to 10.14) can be done by just
upping the second version and starting the new container.

Upgrading between major versions, e.g version 10 to version 11, requires
either a dump/restore or a pg_upgrade, the later might prove tricky in a
container.

1. Check [which versions][5] of postgres are supported by nextcloud. Currently
   versions 9.[56], 10 and 11 are supported.
2. The [postgres version lifecycle][6] is available here. Currently we're
   running postgres 10, which is supported until October 2022.
3. Check [nextcloud notes][4] about postgres.
4. Find the latest [postgres docker tags][7]
